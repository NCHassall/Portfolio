###### - We applied agile methodology and KANBAN task organisation to collaboratively design an engaging musical quiz game. 
###### - It challenges players to identify popular songs, integrating with Spotify's API for up-to-date songs. - In each of the five rounds, players listen to a 10-second song clip, selecting the correct song title from four artist options for points. The game displays a highscore board upon completion. 
###### - To ensure quality, we conducted User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and implemented unit tests for Python logic. 
###### - Reliability was enhanced through integration, regression testing, and efficient code tracking on GitHub.
###### - 🏆 Certification Achieved - Distinction (96%)

###### - I engineered a relational, multi-table database interlinking products, manufacturers, orders, transactions, payments, customers, and reviews using primary and foreign keys. 
###### - This resource is intended for my personal Etsy shop and website, and I visually depicted the interconnections through an EER diagram. 
###### - Employing effective database management, I diligently normalised all tables. 
###### - I harnessed various joins to craft logically connected table views, and my queries and subqueries featured stored functions to compute profits, procedures for dynamic product price updates, and customer insertions. Additionally, I implemented an event to monitor stock levels.
