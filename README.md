- We applied agile methodology and KANBAN task organisation to collaboratively design an engaging musical quiz game. 
- It challenges players to identify popular songs, integrating with Spotify's API for up-to-date songs. - In each of the five rounds, players listen to a 10-second song clip, selecting the correct song title from four artist options for points. The game displays a highscore board upon completion. 
- To ensure quality, we conducted User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and implemented unit tests for Python logic. 
- Reliability was enhanced through integration, regression testing, and efficient code tracking on GitHub.
- 🏆 Certification Achieved - Distinction (96%)
